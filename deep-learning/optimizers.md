### **üõ† Optimizer Cheat Sheet**

| Optimizer                               | Best for                                            | Pros ‚úÖ                                               | Cons ‚ùå                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**   | Large datasets, online learning                     | Efficient for large data, generalizes well           | Requires careful tuning of learning rate, slower convergence |
| **Momentum SGD**                        | High-dimensional problems                           | Faster convergence than vanilla SGD                  | Still needs learning rate tuning                             |
| **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)** | Smooth, convex problems                             | Improves momentum by looking ahead                   | Slightly more complex implementation                         |
| **AdaGrad**                             | Sparse data (e.g., NLP, recommendation systems)     | No need to tune learning rate per feature            | Learning rate decreases too much over time                   |
| **RMSProp**                             | Non-stationary problems (e.g., deep learning, RNNs) | Adapts learning rate, prevents AdaGrad's decay issue | Requires tuning decay parameter                              |
| **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**   | Most deep learning tasks                            | Combines momentum + RMSProp, adaptive learning rate  | Can lead to poor generalization (overfits sometimes)         |
| **AdamW**                               | Deep learning with weight decay                     | Better generalization than Adam                      | Requires tuning weight decay                                 |
| **Adadelta**                            | Limited memory situations                           | No need to set learning rate                         | Less commonly used                                           |
| **Nadam (Adam + NAG)**                  | Faster convergence                                  | Improves Adam with look-ahead momentum               | More computation than Adam                                   |
| **L-BFGS (Limited-memory BFGS)**        | Small datasets, convex problems                     | Second-order optimization without full Hessian       | Not scalable to deep learning                                |

### **üîç How to Choose?**

#### **üî¢ Based on Dataset Size**

* **Small datasets** ‚Üí L-BFGS, Adam
* **Medium datasets** ‚Üí Adam, RMSProp
* **Large datasets** ‚Üí SGD, Momentum SGD, AdamW

#### **‚ö°Ô∏è Based on Convergence Speed**

* **Fast convergence required?** ‚Üí Adam, Nadam
* **Slower but stable?** ‚Üí SGD with Momentum, RMSProp

#### **üåä Based on Data Type**

* **Sparse data (e.g., NLP, embeddings)** ‚Üí AdaGrad, RMSProp
* **Dense data (e.g., vision, tabular)** ‚Üí Adam, SGD with Momentum

#### **üîÄ Based on Noise in Gradients**

* **Noisy gradients (e.g., reinforcement learning, RNNs, online learning)** ‚Üí RMSProp, Adam
* **Stable gradients (e.g., batch training, tabular data)** ‚Üí SGD with Momentum

#### **üéØ General Recommendation**

* If unsure, start with **Adam**. If it overfits or behaves poorly, switch to **SGD with Momentum** or **AdamW**.

#### **When Adam is a Good Choice**

* **Works well for most deep learning tasks** (CNNs, RNNs, transformers, etc.).
* **Converges faster than plain SGD**, especially in noisy environments.
* **Doesn‚Äôt require much hyperparameter tuning** (default settings often work).

#### **‚ùå When Adam Might Not Be the Best Choice**

| Problem Scenario                                              | Why Adam Might Not Work                                            | Better Alternative                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Overfitting happens**                                       | Adam adapts too aggressively, leading to poor generalization       | **AdamW** (Adam with weight decay) |
| **You need best generalization (e.g., Image Classification)** | Adam can converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution             | **SGD with Momentum**              |
| **Training very large datasets (e.g., billion+ samples)**     | Adam uses more memory due to per-parameter adaptive learning rates | **SGD with Momentum**              |
| **Training on Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks**             | Adam struggles with high variance gradients                        | **RMSProp**                        |
| **Training deep networks (e.g., Transformers, LSTMs)**        | Adam works but may lead to instability                             | **AdamW** (better stability)       |

***

#### **üöÄ Practical Rule of Thumb**

* **Start with Adam** if you‚Äôre unsure.
* If you see **overfitting** ‚Üí Try **AdamW** or **SGD with Momentum**.
* If you need **better generalization** ‚Üí Use **SGD with Momentum**.
* If you work with **reinforcement learning** ‚Üí Use **RMSProp**.
