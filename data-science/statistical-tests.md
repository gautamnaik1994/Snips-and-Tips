# Statistical Tests

A telecom company had taken a **survey** of smartphone owners in a certain town 5 years back and found **73%** of the population own a **smartphone**, and have been since using this data to make their business decisions.

Now a new marketing manager has joined, and he believes this value is not valid anymore. Thus he conducts a survey of **500 people** and finds that **420** of them responded with affirmation as to owning a smartphone.  Which **statistical test** would you use to **compare** these two survey data?



1. **Test of proportions, z-test:**
   * **Applicability:** This is the correct option. The z-test for proportions is suitable when comparing the proportions of two independent samples. In this case, you are comparing the proportion of smartphone owners in the town based on the data from 5 years ago (73%) and the recent survey (where 420 out of 500 respondents own a smartphone).
   * **Reasoning:** The z-test for proportions allows you to assess whether the observed difference in proportions is statistically significant. It is appropriate when you have a large sample size (which is often the case in surveys) and when the conditions for using a z-test are met.
2. **Test of independence, chi-square test:**
   * **Applicability:** The chi-square test of independence is used when you have categorical data and want to test if there is a significant association between two variables.
   * **Reasoning:** While the chi-square test is useful in certain scenarios, it is not the best choice for comparing proportions between two independent samples. It is more suitable for analyzing contingency tables with categorical data.
3. **Test of means, t-test:**
   * **Applicability:** The t-test is used when comparing means of two independent samples, not proportions.
   * **Reasoning:** Since you are interested in comparing the proportion of smartphone owners, the t-test is not the appropriate choice. The t-test is used for continuous data (such as comparing the means of two groups) and is not suitable for proportions.
