# Hypothesis Testing

Type 1 Error (False Positive):

This occurs when the model incorrectly rejects a true null hypothesis (H0 is true, but the model predicts H1).

Type 2 Error (False Negative):

This happens when the model fails to reject a false null hypothesis (H0 is false, but the model predicts H0).

## Pregnancy Example

Ho: Patient not pregnant   H1: Patient pregnant

Type 1 Error (): Telling a man that he is pregnant Type 2 Error (): Telling a pregnant woman that she is not pregnant
