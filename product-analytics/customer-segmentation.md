# Customer Segmentation

## Types of Segmentation

- Technographic segmentation : refers to segmenting your customers based on a technology or a group of technologies.
- Behavioral segmentation : divides the market into minor groups based on peopleâ€™s buying habits, likes, and wants.
- Needs-based segmentation : involves segmenting customer groups by their financial, emotional, and physical needs.
- Customer status or customer lifecycle : segmentation refers to grouping customers based on their place in the customer lifecycle. This includes leads, new customers, loyal/long-time customers, at-risk customers, and churned customers. RFM is a method to achieve this.
